Credit cards seem to have a love/hate reputation with people. Some people love them, and some people absolutely HATE them.

I sit somewhat in between the two groups - I'm not in love with credit cards, but certain cards can be used properly as *TOOLS* to help lessen the financial burden of normal spending - to offset costs, if you will.

If someone offered you 5% back on everything you were going to buy anyways, or points towards travel on purchases you were already going to make, you'd be silly not to take that offer!

So here we are, unboxing and reviewing the new Platinum card from American Express that just came in the mail.

After the unboxing, I'm going to go through all of the various benefits and offers that you can take advantage of with the platinum card, and then we're going to do some back-of-the-napkin math to determine at which point it's worth it for you to get this card since it comes with a whopping $550 annual fee plus $175 per year for each additional card you add.

The benefits list for the Amex Platinum card is extensive. Let's start with the most important - the signup bonus.

The Amex platinum card has a signup bonus ranging from 75,000-125,000 points, depending on when you visit the website. I've noticed if you keep a tab open on the website for a while, you be presented with a "session expired" alert. Clicking "refreshing session" to close the alert will bump the point offer for you.

I personally applied for the card under the 75,000 point bonus offer, but soon after being approved I started seeing the 100,000 point offer on their website - go figure. I've yet to see the 125,000 point signup offer advertised to me, but I'd recommend just refreshing your session a bunch of times until the best offer presents itself before applying.

The **75,000 rewards point bonus** can be met with the following:

- Spend $5,000 on purchases on your new card within 6 months of card membership

This was actually easy for us to do because we had a large expense of over $7k that we HAD to make. Job done.

Carefully consider whether you, personally, will spend the bonus requirements before the 6 month period is up. Many people get sucked into *trying* to spend the minimum by buying things they otherwise wouldn't have purchased had they not got the card. This is where Amex makes a hefty profit!

In addition to the 75,000 rewards points offer, Amex also gives **10x points** on all eligible purchases at gas stations and supermarkets **on up to $15,000** in combined purchases within the first 6 months.

We definitely won't be spending $15,000 at gas stations and supermarkets in the next 6 months (maybe 12 months), but this is still a nice bonus *on top of* the 75,000 rewards points, and I believe they can overlap. That means you can spend $5,000 at gas stations and supermarkets over the next 6 months, get 75,000 rewards points, plus earn 10x points per dollar for a total of 50,000 + 75,000 = 125,000 points. 150,000 or 175,000 if you received the 100k or 125k signup offers, respectively.

Be advised in the fine print Amex does not deem marina or jet fuel as an *eligible purchase*. For those with boats or planes...sorry ðŸ™‚.

Moving on to other ways to earn with the Amex Platinum card, and the main reasons for getting this card!

**5x points on travel** booked directly with airlines or through Amex travel, on up to $500,000 in purchases per calendar year.

If you travel a lot of business, get this card. It will pay for itself many times over.

You'll also earn **5x points on prepaid hotels**. This simply means you have to book and pay for a hotel in advance, using the Platinum card, through Amex travel online or by phone.

**Warning**: From Amex terms:

> Eligible hotel purchases are prepaid hotel purchases booked with American Express Travel and prepaid flight+hotel packages booked on AmexTravel.com with your eligible Platinum Card and charged to the same eligible Platinum Card, minus returns and credits. To modify a reservation, you must cancel and rebook your reservation. You can cancel and rebook your reservation on AmexTravel.com or by calling a representative of AmexTravel.com at 1-800-297-2977. Cancellations are subject to hotel cancellation policies. If hotel reservations are made or modified directly with the hotel provider, the reservation will NOT be eligible for 5X points. 

So if you call a hotel after booking to change your reservation, you might wipe out your bonus points.

For all other purchases, you earn **1x point per dollar with no limit**.

But, it doesn't stop there! Amex provides you with a **ton** of random freebies and offers that you should take advantage of to really maximize the benefits of this card.

Uber and Amex have partnered to offer $15 per month in Uber credits that qualify for both Rides and Eats. You'll also be given a bonus $20 in December for a total of $200 per year in Uber credits, and you'll become an Uber VIP member so you'll get priority pickup and matched with higher rated drivers. 

I didn't see this on the Amex website, but I also received a free year of Eats Pass, giving me 10% of 3 rides per "cycle," $0 delivery fee plus 15% off eligible orders over $15, and a $0 delivery fee on grocery orders over $30. I'll take it!

**The catch**: You *must* add your Platinum card as a payment method in the Uber app to activate these offers.

Amex also gives you **$100 in statement credits** annually for purchases made at Saks Fifth Avenue (online or in store). The purchases must be split into $50 purchases on a semi-annual basis. One between Jan-June, and the other between July and December. Obviously Saks is really expensive, I recommend checking out the sales and buying some perfume or something.

**Additional Gold Card**

Phew...that's a lot!

For frequent travelers and spendy business folks, this card pays for itself many times over. For the rest of us, let's do a bit a math to figure out what the *minimum* annual spend would have to be for the first year on this card to cover the $550 annual fee.

Each point is worth $0.01, and you get 1 point per dollar for all regular purchases.

Let's assume you're smart (because you read this blog and watch my YouTube channel), and you've doubled up on your Amex points and spent $5,000 in the first 6 months at supermarkets and gas stations, so you got 125,000 points. At $0.01 per point, that comes out to **$1,250**.

$1,250 / $550 = 2.27 years paid for on the card. This doesn't include the $200 in annual Uber credits (which don't roll over btw so you should use them).

So, if you were *already going to spend* that $5,000 then this card is worth it. Also, if you spend $200 per year or more at Uber, this might be worth looking into. The $200 subtracts itself if you're an Uber regular, making the card cost **$350 per year**. 

You'll need to run around $35,000 per year in regular purchases through this card to make it worth it.

If you spend on travel, that number reduces to $7,000 per year. Easily achieved with the frequent flyer.

The value of the other benefits is up to you to determine. Obviously accessing the Centurion lounge is fun, but what's it's worth is unique to each cardholder.

Personally, we'll be running enough through this card annually to essentially receive a discount on normal spending, but I urge readers/viewers not to get carried away and spend more than they normally would just for the points.
