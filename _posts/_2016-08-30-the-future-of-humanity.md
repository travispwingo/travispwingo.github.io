I've been thinking a lot about the future lately, and there are still quite a bit
of obvious changes that need to happen in order for the future of humanity to be
a positive one.

This blog post serves as the "master plan" for a greater vision of humanity - one
that stretches far beyond where we are today, and pulls back at the curtains of
our potential. It will list categories that I believe we need to explore in much
greater detail and adopt in order to have a lasting civilization.

This post is neither right nor wrong, nor is it intended to spark debate
(albeit it will). This is simply a thought exercise to push forward and
accelerate true forward-thinking.

Topics covered:

* Sustainable and efficient energy generation and storage
* Decentralized currency
* Fast, efficient travel
* Gravity
* Barriers to entry on education
* Health and immortality
* Interstellar Dwelling

# Energy
