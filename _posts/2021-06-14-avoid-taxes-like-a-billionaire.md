So recently a [ProPublica article](https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax) was released that basically exposed the tax returns of America’s wealthiest individuals and I immediately felt like I needed to make a video about this topic to address some common misconceptions when it comes to taxes. 

The average annual income in the US is around $50,000 give or take.

$50,000 per year equates to roughly $137 per day.

To be in the top 1% of income earners, you’ll need to make 10x this amount, or $500,000 per year which equates to $1,370 per day.

Now imagine you’d like to make $1m per year. Only 0.3% of people in the US make $1m or more per year, or $2,740 per day. That’s TWICE the average rent payment. Every, single, day.

For most people, making $1m per year is more than enough. As long as you’re not competing with your neighbors for the biggest house or most expensive cars, $1m per year is enough to save more than half of your take-home pay while also living a very luxurious lifestyle.

But then, there’s a small minority of individuals in this country that have far more than $1m. These are the billionaires. The elite…the 0.00024%.

Out of 330 million people, only 800 are wealthy enough to earn the status of billionaire.

But just how much is $1 billion?

To put it in perspective, for the average salaried employee earning $50,000 per year, it would take 20,000 years to earn $1 billion.

Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, is worth $186.8 billion as of the time of this video.

For the average salaried worker earning $50,000 per year, it would take 3,737,000 years to make that fortune.

In other words - for the average salaried employee, it’s mathematically impossible.

So the recent ProPublica article that was releases exposed the tax returns of the worlds wealthiest individuals, and Jeff Bezos was among them.

And even though he’s worth $186.8 billion, in most years he paid less income taxes as a percentage of his income than the average salaried employee.

And as a result of learning this information, people were unsurprisingly upset. 

They call it greedy that their “true tax” rate is less than the average person who’s breaking their back every day working hard for the American dream…they say it’s an outrage, and it’s unfair!

But it actually is fair, and perfectly legal, and everyone has access to the same tax strategies as billionaires…they just don’t take advantage of them.

And this article is going to explain how income taxes work, why the average salaried employee pays more income taxes as a percentage of their income on an annual basis than the worlds wealthiest, and how you can position yourself to build wealth the same way.

Before we begin, let me remind you that I’m not a CPA, I am not a financial advisor, I’m not a billionaire, and this is not financial advice. 

There is simply a lot of misinformation about this topic going on right now and I would like to use this video to try to clear up confusion and explain this in, hopefully, an easy to understand way so that you too can take advantage of the same tax strategies used by the ultra wealthy.

So to start, in the United States we pay taxes on all income. And income taxes increase as your income increases, in brackets.

This is called a progressive tax, and each tax bracket only applies to a range of income. If a rate is already applied to dollars within a specific range, those same dollars do not get taxed at a higher rate.

For example, a single filer in the US pays 10% tax on all income up to $9,875, and 12% on any income over $9,875 up to $40,125. 

This does not mean that if you make $9,876 you pay 12% on everything. You’ll only pay 12% on $1, and 10% on $9,875. 

It is a very common misconception that landing in a higher tax bracket means ALL of your money is now taxed at a higher rate.

And some people have even gone as far as to avoid promotions and pay raises arguing that they’d take home LESS money as a result of a higher tax bracket. That is incorrect, don’t listen to anyone who tries to tell you that.

In addition to income taxes, we also have capital gains taxes. And these are simply taxes on the difference between buying an asset at a lower price and selling it at a higher price.

If sell it within 1 year of buying it, the gain is taxed at your normal income rate and it becomes part of your income, also called a short term capital gain.

If you sell it more than 1 year after buying it, it is subject to what’s called long term capital gains tax, which is up to 20% depending on how much money you make.

And btw, capital gains taxes are the same taxes that Joe Biden is trying to alter - effectively doubling them to 39.6% if you make $1m or more per year.

But when it comes to capital gains, there is one major difference.

You are not taxed UNLESS you REALIZE the gain. 

In other words, if you buy stock in a company, or a house, or an index fund - you don’t owe any tax on that asset if the value increases UNLESS you sell it.

If the tax system worked this way, people wouldn’t invest, and the economy would essentially come to a stand still. Taxing assets just because they appreciate in value would force people to sell assets constantly and drive prices for all assets down.

So, if you bought a house to live in, and the price of the house goes up in value every year, you don’t owe taxes on the amount of the gain from when you bought it to its present value. That would be absurd and no one would agree to those terms.

You only owe money if you sell the asset and REALIZE the gain by converting it into cash. At which point the value can no longer change, and it becomes income for the year, and taxed as either short or long term capital gains.

And this is exactly the method that wealthy individuals use to build their wealth.

So to make this super ultra clear, let me paint a picture of how this would work with an example.

Let’s say you start a new company that cures cancer, and your product is a tank that you lie in like a tanning bed and after a few minutes in this tank, some magic happens, and any cancer you had in your body is now gone.

Because curing cancer at the press of a button is a life changing discovery, your company is incredibly valuable.

But, in order to bring this to the market and make it available for everyone and not just the ultra wealthy, you need to raise a lot of money.

So, you decide to take your company public with an IPO or initial public offering.

After the IPO, your partial ownership in your cancer curing miracle company is worth $1 billion. You’re a billionaire. Pretty cool.

But wait, you don’t actually have $1 billion in your bank account. Your shares of common stock on the public market are worth $1 billion collectively, but that’s only if you sell them today.

Selling all of your shares today would signal to the rest of the world that you actually don’t want to work on this company anymore or you don’t have faith in it anymore, which would cause the price of the stock to come crumbling down. 

So, you decide not to sell your stock, and you just hold it in your brokerage account, and you pay yourself a small salary just enough to cover your living expenses, and stay focused on curing cancer.

Because you’ve decided to hold your stock and not sell it, every day the “value” of your account moves up or down dramatically. Some days, the number is down $50 million. Other days, the value is up $10 million.

The only way to guarantee the value of the stock is to sell it, and convert it into cash. Until then, the value of the account is considered to be “unrealized.” It doesn’t count. Therefore, it’s impossible to calculate any taxes on unrealized gains, because the value today could be far greater than the value tomorrow, and vice versa.

This is how billionaires build their wealth, and why they pay so little in taxes on a regular basis.

They risk everything and leave their money tied up in volatile investments that could become worthless at any moment. But, as a result of taking that risk, they don’t have to pay income taxes on those investments. It’s a benefit to the potential of waking up one day to find that your investments are now worth $0.

And whenever they do need some money, they just sell some their investments. And when that happens, yes they pay taxes. And when they pay taxes, they pay more taxes than the average person would pay over multiple lifetimes.  

In fact, according to the very same ProPublica article that “exposed” the tax returns, Jeff Bezos paid $973 million in taxes between 2014 and 2018. 

If the average salaried employee earning $50,000 per year were to pay $973 million in taxes, it would take them 144,187 YEARS assuming an annual federal tax liability of $6,748.16 an 0 deductions.

So now that you sorta maybe kinda understand how taxation works around investments and assets, here’s how you can put your money to work so that you can avoid paying taxes just like the ultra wealthy. 

Because the average individual gets paid a taxable salary, you’ll need to learn to focus that income into investments and begin to build a secondary wealth source for yourself. 

This means cutting back on expenses as much as you can or, if you’re unable to cut back on expenses any further, getting a second job like food delivery to give you extra income to invest. 

Once you’ve got a clear handle on where all of your money is going every single month, you need to funnel as much money as possible into investments. 

Now I’m not at all qualified to recommend any investments in particular, but this could as simple as buying a total stock market or S&P 500 index fund each month using automatic investments at your brokerage and simply forgetting about it.

Don’t even check it’s balance. We have a tendency to react to changes in the stock market, not reacting is probably your best course of action. 

Over the years you’ll be contributing to this account on a regular basis while also allowing the account value to compound on top of itself and grow at a fast rate. 

And the goal here is to get your investments to the point where they’re actually making you more than your job, or at least more than your living expenses. 

At which point you’re considered to be “financially free.”

And you can take this even further and invest in real estate by first purchasing a primary residence that you live in, and then if you’re really killing it, a second property that you can then rent out to someone who then pays your mortgage for you.

And over the years both your stock portfolio and real estate portfolio will grow in value, and you’ll find yourself in the luxurious position of not having to pay a dime of income tax on that growth unless you decide to sell it and “realize” your gains.

And that’s pretty much it. If you want to build your wealth and avoid taxes like a billionaire, all you have to do is funnel as much money as you can into appreciating assets and hold them for as long as possible without selling.

Yes you risk the value of those assets going down over the short term, but realistically if you buy index funds or real estate in a good area, those assets are going to go up in value over the long term.

In fact, over any 20 year period, the S&P 500 has NEVER suffered a loss in value. It’s only gone up.

So it’s safe to say that over the long term you’re, well, safe. But over the short term, anything can happen, which is why I think it’s best to not check the balances on a day to day basis and just keep investing, stick to the plan, and build up your assets as much as you can.

And when you retire, you can finally crack open your brokerage account and get appraisals on your real estate and find yourself a nice little surprise.

As always, the video version of this post is below. Thanks for reading, and i'll see you next time.
