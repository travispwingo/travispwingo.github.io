In a world full of technology and electronics, we are often bombarded with terms
that we seldom understand. Three terms that are thrown in front of us across
all electronic products we purchase today are _volt (V)_, _watt (W)_, and _amp (A)_.
We see them listed everywhere - but what do they mean? Let me break these down
for you.

I like to explain technical topics using every day metaphors that everyone
understands. I find this leaves little room for confusion and allows people to
move on and learn at an accelerated rate. In the case of electrical units,
let's use the well-known garden hose as our metaphor of choice.

Let's start with volts (V).

<b>Volts</b>

The volt is a measure of electric potential - the energy that _could_ be
released if the current was allowed to flow. Under our garden hose metaphor,
volts can be equivocally compared to _water pressure_, or, the potential that the
hose has, should the current be allowed to flow.

Let's say we have a simple garden hose equipped with a spray nozzle. The nozzle
can be either turned on or off, but the main faucet the hose is connected to is
always turned on. Under this circumstance, the water pressure within the hose,
whether or not the hose nozzle is open, remains the same. Now, think of the
water pressure in terms of volts in a house, and think of the nozzle on the end
of the hose in terms of a lightbulb. As long as there is power coming into the
house, the voltage on the line remains the same whether or not the lightbulb
is turned on.

In other words, the electric potential of the line remains constant at 120 volts
(typical US home), regardless of any current flowing. Just like the water
pressure (PSI) in the hose remains constant whether or not water is flowing out
of the nozzle.

Next, amps (A)

<b>Amp</b>

Amps (A) or Amperes, are used to express the flow rate of electric charge.
Going back to our garden hose metaphor, we can think of amps as the flow rate
of water through the hose (gallons per minute). Referring back to volts and
potential, if the hose nozzle is turned off, amps drop to 0, but voltage
(electric potential) remains.

Amps are typically used to determine the current draw of appliances, and the
gauge of wire required for a specific circuit within a home. The higher the
calculated amperes, the thicker the gauge required to support the higher rate
of flow.

<b>Watts</b>

A watt (W) is simply a unit of power. It can be used to express the rate of energy
conversion or transfer with respect to time. Now this, may sound a lot like
amps, but in our garden hose example, think of it as how quickly we can fill up
a bucket with water from the hose. It is also the _product_ of volts and amps -
expressed as the rate at which work is done when one ampere (A) of current flows
through the line with one volt (V) of electric potential.
