When it comes to legally avoiding paying taxes on my money and my investment growth, I like to take advantage of every single account type out there. Because, worst case scenario, if I donâ€™t retire early Iâ€™ll at least have maximized every type of retirement account for many years and sheltered hundreds of thousands of dollars from taxation. Thatâ€™s a worst case scenario we should all aim to achieve.

Most people use common retirement vehicles like IRAs and 401ks to save for retirement, but there's another account out there that operates just as well (better even!) for saving for retirement - the Health Savings Account (HSA).

The Health Savings Account is a special type of savings account that many people are qualified to contribute to, either via their employers benefits programs or personally, but few see past it as anything other than a dedicated savings account for health related expenses.

## What is an HSA?

A Health Savings Account (HSA) is simply a special type of savings account that allows you to contribute pre-tax dollars to use towards qualified medical expenses.

This means that you can deduct up to $3,550 per year for an individual or $7,100 per year for a family by contributing to this account. And the best part is, this account allows you to invest your contributions, and any growth you accumulate is tax free!

So long as you withdraw from the account for qualified medical expenses, which can be anything from a co-payment to a deductible, the money that comes out of the account is also tax free. Tax free in, tax free growth, tax free out. Sounds great!

Here's the catch. In order to qualify for being able to contribute to a Health Savings Account, you must enroll in what's called a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP).

An HDHP simply means that your deductible is much higher than a standard plan, so you'll pay more out of pocket before your insurance can cover your expenses. But on the bight side, your monthly premium will be much lower!

According to Healthcare.gov, the deductible limits and out of pocket maximums in an HDHP for the 2021 calendar year are as follows:

|           | Minimum deductible (The amount you pay for health care items and services before your plan starts to pay) | Maximum out-of-pocket costs (The most youâ€™d have to pay if you need more health care items and services) |
| --- | --- |
| Individual HDHP | $1,400 | $7,000 |
| Family HDHP | $2,800 | $14,000 |

Using the above information, you can expect to pay as much as $14,000 out of pocket (sometimes more) before your insurance will even consider covering the costs.

With this in mind, here are a few things to keep in mind when considering whether to enroll in an HDHP to using an HSA.

## Should I enroll in a High Deductible Health Plan?

An HDHP is typically beneficial for individuals or families who have the following criteria:

- Good health with very low to no annual health related costs
- Strong and reliable income
- High savings rate (>20%) relative to your income
- A healthy emergency fund of 6-12 months of living expenses

Without the above financial foundation, enrolling in a HDHP could end up being a risk that you'll regret taking if a sudden medical expense presents itself.

Without a 6-12 month emergency fund and a high savings rate, a $5,000 medical expense could set you back many months from your plans. This approach is only recommended for those who have already gotten out of debt, built up an emergency fund, and are living on less than 80% of their take-home pay.

For the sake of argument, let's assume you meet the above criteria in order to present the case for leveraging an HSA as a second IRA account for retirement savings.

## How to use an HSA as a Second IRA

The Health Savings Account was designed to help you reduce the costs of medical expenses through tax sheltering both your contributions and the growth in the account.

Using the family contribution limits, this means you can contribute $7,100 per year to your HSA in pre-tax dollars. That's a full $1,100 (18%!) more than an IRA!

And because HSA accounts are allowed to earn interest or investment appreciation, this means you can stick your HSA contributions into individual stocks or index funds and enjoy the compounding effects of market growth over the years.

So long as you keep the money in the account, it'll keep growing tax free.

Taking your money out of the account is where the real magic happens...

The IRS allows you to withdraw funds from your HSA TAX FREE as long as they are for qualified medical expenses. But, there's a catch here.

There is no requirement to withdraw the funds from the HSA at the time of the medical expense. In fact, there is no requirement to EVER withdraw funds from your HSA for any medical expenses if you don't need to. And technically, you can withdraw medical expense from your HSA at ANY TIME in the future. Whether that's 20 days or 20 YEARS from now.

So what does this mean? Well, check this out...

Let's say you're a financially responsible individual with a family who's relatively healthy with very little medical expenses over a 20 year period. Because you rarely require health insurance, you opt for a High Deductible Health Plan and max out your HSA at $7,100 per year for the family.

Because you save and invest responsibly, maintain a 6-12 month emergency fund, and live below your means, any medical expenses you incur are taken care of out of pocket since your deductible, although high, isn't enough to break the bank even if maxed out. In fact, that's what your emergency fund is for!

So rather than pay for medical expenses out of your HSA, you opt to pay them out of pocket and allow your HSA contributions to grow 8% per year in a total market index fund for 20 years.

At 8% per year for 20 years your HSA will grow to $383,480 assuming $7,100 in annual contributions. Considering you only contributed $141,998 that's pretty good!

Now here's where things get cool.

Because there's no time limit on WHEN you can withdraw medical expenses from an HSA, technically you can just save all of your receipts and begin withdrawing any qualified expenses at any point. So that's what you do.

You save every single receipt (scanned onto a hard drive for simplicity and search ability), and now you can withdraw your money TAX FREE from your HSA as long as you have a qualified medical expense to pair it to. Over 20 years, this can add up to a lot!

And for the rest of the account, once you reach retirement age, the withdrawals are simply treated like a traditional IRA and taxed on the way out.

Effectively what you've done here is allowed yourself access to a SECOND IRA to shield $7,100 per year in income from taxation (hopefully during your higher income years), and then earned tax free compound growth on your investments before withdrawing them tax free to match any qualified medical expenses you had over your account lifetime.

Therefore, the HSA is a sort of special IRA if you think about it. If not used for medical expenses, it defaults to a traditional IRA. If used for medical expenses, it's like a hybrid traditional/Roth IRA where you can avoid taxation on the way in, while it grows, and on the way out.

And over a long enough time frame, those little checkups and minor accidents can add up to quite a bit, so you could end up withdrawing a healthy sum from your HSA TAX FREE in retirement, so long as you keep the receipts ðŸ˜‰.
