Hey there! Didn't see ya there - I'm Travis. A Software Engineer in the Bay Area who majored in Economics and Computer Science at Santa Clara University. I also happen to be a massive personal finance nerd, so that's what this site and what most of my hobbies revolve around.

I created a YouTube channel towards the end of 2020 to share what I know about personal finance with others, and I created this site as a second vehicle to spread the word about the topics I cover. The posts here are usually always accompanied by a YouTube video, and vice versa.

I know what you're thinking: "this guy's into personal finance? What a lame hobby!" But to that I reply with this:

Money is part of everything we do whether we like it or not. We exchange currency for goods and services, for shelter and food. Not understanding how to manage your money, budget your money, or make more money will ultimately reduce your quality of life. Sometimes to the point of great discomfort or depression.

This isn't a channel about accumulating vast amounts of wealth (although you can use these strategies to do that as well!), this is simply a channel about educating people on one of the most important but also most misunderstood topics in the world today. 

Getting a grip on your personal finances means getting a grip on your life.

It means less stress, more smiling, laughing, giving, and enjoying time with friends and family. Freedom.

So subscribe, kick back, and let's learn some stuff about money. Not to get rich, but to just live better lives.

Thanks for stopping by, I'll see ya in the comments ðŸ™‚.
